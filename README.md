#  Partition of YOLOv3_TensorFlow
### Modification

Implementation on initial version of partitioning neural network, feature map compression.
This is modification of repo: [YOLOv3_tensorflow](https://github.com/wizyoung/YOLOv3_TensorFlow).

## Idea of Network Partitioning

- Partitioning of an AI model
   - Divide a neural network 
   - Save partial networks to separate models
   - Deliver intermediate data between them 
- Pros and cons of AI model partitioning
  - Pros: Small device computing resources comparing to the original model
  - Cons: One additional transmission of intermediate data
- Consideration on the Intermediate Data
  - Intermediate data size depends on the layer where division occurs
  - If that layer has many neurons, intermediate data size will increase
- Intermediate Data Compression Method 
  - To reduce the effect of intermediate data transmission


## Process of Feature Map Compression & Decompression

- Sender: Sparsification â€“ Quantization - Entropy Coding 
- Receiver: Decoding and dequantization
